MANCALA_OVERVIEW = Players begin by placing 3 of stones in each of the bins on the game board except for the home bins at either end. \
 A turn consists of removing all seeds from a bin, "sowing" the seeds, one at a time, into bins in counter-clockwise order. \
 If the last stone placed is in an empty bin owned by the player, then they can capture the opponent stones in the opposite \
 bin by moving  them to their home bin. When sowing stones, the opponent home bin is skipped. A round is over when all of a \
  players bins have been emptied. Whoever has more stones in the home bin wins.
